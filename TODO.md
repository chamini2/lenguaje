##Intermediate Code

* Check if variable is in top scope or not

* Arrays
* Structures (Records/Unions)
* Initialize Variables

##General

* Functions have a `width` that **may be wrong**
* Decorate the AST `Either Expression (Expression, DataType)` -- or something like this
* Find strings in intermediate code (add it to the symbol table with a unique id or add it to symbolt able by its content?) -- DONE, maybe
* Functions may not return some times

##Someday

* Pointers
